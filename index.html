            <h1>Biography</h1>
            <p> Ritchie was born on September 9, 1941, in Bronx-ville, New York. 
              He was born to Alistair Ritchie, a switching systems engineer for Bell Laboratories, and Jean McGee Ritchie, a homemaker. 
              Ritchie grew up in New Jersey, and after a childhood in which he did very well academically, he went on to attend Harvard University. 
              There he studied science and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in physics. 
              While he was still going to school, Ritchie happened to go to a lecture about how Harvard’s computer system, a Univac I, worked. 
              He was fascinated by what he heard and wanted to find out more. 
              Outside of his Harvard studies, Ritchie began to explore computers more thoroughly and was especially interested in how they were programmed.
            </p>
            <p>While still at Harvard, Ritchie got a job working at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). 
              At that time computer programming was not a degree, and computer labs were looking for anyone with the potential to help on their computers. 
              Ritchie, with his unflagging curiosity, seemed perfect for the job. 
              Ritchie worked at MIT for many years helping develop, alongside other scientists, more advanced computer systems and software.

            </blockquote>
            <p>Ritchie is best known as the creator of the C programming language, a key developer of the Unix operating system, and co-author of the book The C Programming Language; 
              he was the 'R' in K&R (a common reference to the book's authors Kernighan and Ritchie). 
              Ritchie worked together with Ken Thompson, who is credited with writing the original version of Unix; 
              one of Ritchie's most important contributions to Unix was its porting to different machines and platforms. 
              They were so influential on Research Unix that Doug McIlroy later wrote, 
              "The names of Ritchie and Thompson may safely be assumed to be attached to almost everything not otherwise attributed."
            </p>
            <p> Ritchie liked to emphasize that he was just one member of a group. 
              He suggested that many of the improvements he introduced simply "looked like a good thing to do," 
              and that anyone else in the same place at the same time might have done the same thing. 
              But Bjarne Stroustrup who designed C++ said "If Dennis had decided to spend that decade on esoteric math, Unix would have been stillborn."
            </p>
            <p> Nowadays, the C language is widely used today in application, operating system, and embedded system development, and its influence is seen in most modern programming languages. 
              Unix has also been influential, establishing computing concepts and principles that have been widely adopted.
            </p>
            <h2>Outstanding Awards</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="award-year">1983</span>: Ritchie and Thompson received the Turing Award <i>for their development of generic operating systems theory and specifically for the implementation of the UNIX operating system</i></li>
              <li><span class="award-year">1990</span>: Ritchie and Thompson received the IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), “for the origination of the UNIX operating system and the C programming language”</li>
              <li><span class="award-year">1997</span>: Ritchie and Thompson were made Fellows of the Computer History Museum, “for co-creation of the UNIX operating system, and development of the C programming language”</li>
              <li><span class="award-year">1999</span>: Thompson and Ritchie jointly received the National Medal of Technology of 1998 from President Bill Clinton for co-inventing the UNIX operating system and the C programming language which, according to the citation for the medal, 
              “led to enormous advances in computer hardware, software, and networking systems and stimulated the growth of an entire industry, thereby enhancing American leadership in the Information Age”</li>
              <li><span class="award-year">2005</span>: the Industrial Research Institute awarded Ritchie its Achievement Award in recognition of his contribution to science and technology, and to society generally, with his development of the Unix operating system</li>
              <li><span class="award-year">2011</span>: Ritchie, along with Thompson, was awarded the Japan Prize for Information and Communications for his work in the development of the Unix operating system</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Death & Legacy</h2>
            <p>Ritchie was found dead on October 12, 2011, at the age of 70 at his home in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, where he lived alone. 
              First news of his death came from his former colleague, Rob Pike. 
              The cause and exact time of death have not been disclosed. 
              He had been in frail health for several years following treatment for prostate cancer and heart disease.
            </p>
            <p>Dennis Ritchie was the godfather of programming. 
              However, it seemed when Ritchie died only about a week and a half after Steve Jobs, no one really gave him the recognition, media, and the tribute he deserved.
              Dennis Ritchie never led a multi billion-dollar corporation, sought the public eye, or had his every utterance scrutinized and re-scrutinized. 
              Ritchie was by all accounts a quiet, modest man with a strong work ethic and dry sense of humor. 
              But the legacy of his work played a key role in spawning the technological revolution of the last forty years — including technology on which Apple & Microsoft went on to build its fortune.
